# Flask-Random-Image
A Flask app that slideshows random images from a host directory

## Setup
Very complicated steps:
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. Run `make`

Very hard, I know.

You can edit the `app.ini` file to change some settings (WIP).

## FAQ (not really frequent... or asked)
"Can I PR?" - Feel free too but I don't have to time to code review so it'll just be ignored ðŸ«¡

"Can you implement X?" - If it doesn't take a decade and a half, I can think about it.

"Wanna go on a date?" - Nah.
